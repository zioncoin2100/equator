# Equator


Equator is the [client facing API](https://github.com/zion2100/go/tree/master/services/equator/docs) server for the Zion ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between zion-core and applications that want to access the Zion network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Zion ecosystem](http://zionc.info/developers/guides/get-started/) for more details.
